# Genesis Sample Theme with Foundation 6

This is a work-in-progress version of the Genesis Sample Theme using the Foundation framework (version 6.2).

Github project link: https://github.com/danielck/genesis-sample-foundation/

## Build instructions

Requires node, npm and Bower.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` inside the assets/ directory. Then run `grunt` or `grunt watch`.

## Customizing

The theme is intended as a starting point for projects and by default only includes the styles and JS necessary for the features in the base theme. Edit `/assets/styles/scss/app.scss` to enable or disable parts of Foundation and `/assets/grunt/concat.js` for JavaScript.

## Installation Instructions

1. Upload the Genesis Sample theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Genesis Sample theme.
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.


## Theme Support

None. Pull requests and issues are welcome.
